Coaxial cables are vital for high-voltage energy transmission, but defects, material 
imperfections, and thermal stresses can impact their performance. This study 
investigates the electric field and thermal behavior of a coaxial cable with four 
components: conductor, insulator, aluminum shield, and void. By using numerical 
and analytical methods, it examines the effects of void shape, position, and material 
non-linearities on field and temperature distributions, providing insights to enhance 
cable reliability and safety.
